   - Contains multiple concerns (location, audio, UI, gestures)
   - **Risk**: Maintenance nightmare, hard to test, poor performance
   - **Action**: Refactor into smaller, focused components

2. **API Endpoint Mismatch**:
   - API service uses `localhost:3001`
   - Web package uses `localhost:8080`
   - **Risk**: Mobile app won't connect to backend
   - **Action**: Standardize API endpoints across packages

3. **Production Hardcoded URLs**:
   - Development URLs hardcoded in API service
   - **Risk**: Won't work in production environment
   - **Action**: Use environment variables for API URLs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Issues:

1. **Complex Hook Dependencies**:
   - Some hooks have complex interdependencies
   - Could lead to circular dependency issues
   - **Risk**: Difficult to maintain and test
   - **Action**: Simplify hook architecture

2. **Native Module Dependencies**:
   - Volume button service depends on native modules that may not exist
   - **Risk**: Runtime crashes on devices without proper setup
   - **Action**: Add proper fallback handling

3. **Missing Error Boundaries**:
   - No error boundaries around navigation or main components
   - **Risk**: App crashes from unhandled errors
   - **Action**: Add error boundaries at key levels

### üîç Minor Issues:

1. **Console Logging in Production**:
   - Extensive console.log statements throughout
   - **Risk**: Performance impact and information leakage
   - **Action**: Remove or make environment-conditional

2. **Hardcoded Configuration Values**:
   - Threshold values and timeouts hardcoded in components
   - **Risk**: Difficult to tune for different scenarios
   - **Action**: Move to configuration files

## üõ†Ô∏è Improvement Suggestions

1. **Refactor Dashboard Component**:

   ```typescript
   // Split DashboardScreen.tsx into:
   // - DashboardScreen.tsx (main container)
   // - LocationSection.tsx (location controls)
   // - AudioSection.tsx (audio streaming)
   // - StatusSection.tsx (device status)
   // - EmergencySection.tsx (emergency features)
   ```

2. **Standardize API Configuration**:

   ```typescript
   // Use environment variables
   const API_BASE_URL =
     process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:8080/api/v1";
   ```

3. **Add Error Boundaries**:
   ```typescript
   // In App.tsx
   <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorScreen />}>
     <AuthProvider>
       <SocketProvider>
         <AppNavigator />
       </SocketProvider>
     </AuthProvider>
   </ErrorBoundary>
   ```

### üîß Medium Priority:

   } catch (error) {
     console.warn("Volume manager not available, using alternative method");
     this.setupAlternativeVolumeDetection();
   }
   ```

2. **Add Comprehensive Testing**:

   ```typescript
   // Add tests for:
   // - Hook functionality
   // - Navigation flows
   // - API service methods
   // - Impact detection algorithms
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   ```typescript
   // Add React.memo for expensive components

   ```typescript
   // Create config/settings.ts
   export const IMPACT_DETECTION_SETTINGS = {
     sensitivity: "medium",
     thresholds: {
       /* ... */
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Advanced Security Features**:
   - Add app integrity checking
